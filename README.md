## About
This is a chat bot which spreads awareness about mental health, debunking stigmas and myths surrounding it. It provides self-assessment and guidelines for stress, anxiety, depression, suicidal thoughts and many disorders like dysthymia, schizophrenia etc. It offers relevant tools and resources to help users find healthy coping strategies. It encourages the users to reach out for help and sensitizes them about being there as a social support for a person suffering. It also helps identify the mental health illness a person might be suffering from and encourages the user to seek treatment as early as possible. This chatbot can improve mental health counselling as chatbots can provide a user with instant information, they have 24/7 availability and they provide cost savings for the users in the form of travel expenses and telephone charges
## Azure Services Used:
The chatbot is created using Microsoft Azure Cognitive Language Service and Azure Bot Service and is embedded into a website that is hosted using Azure Static Web Apps.
